# Windows-Kernel-Driver-Talk
The files I used in my Windows Kernel Talk

# Building and running the driver
In order to build this driver, you need visual studio, spectre mitigated libs, winddk and winsdk. 

The driver is located in the /kdmapper-master/HelloWorld folder, main.c. 

# Building KdMapper
Open the .sln in visual studio and build it. 

# Building PrintLoop
Its a c++ program, you can open the .sln file in Visual Studio and build it or you can just build it directly with cmake, whatever you want. Just get it to run

# For those who are lazy. I uploaded my builds of these file to a zip in releases. Careful. KdMapper can get detected as malware so download in a vm
